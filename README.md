# Basic Link List Page

This is a very simple single page link list page that uses Eleventy to build it.

* `npm run dev` to run a local dev server and watch changes
* `npm run build` to build the site into the _site folder

## Personalize It For You

* Change the main image by replacing the hero.jpg in src/images with your own image
* Write your own content in index.md (uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) format)
* Change the colors in styles.css
* Change the font using a different one from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
* Change the favicon
* Make any other changes to the layout in src/_includes/layout.njk
